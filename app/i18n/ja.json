Our intent is to allow you as much control as possible over your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how Okkami collects, stores, and uses your information.

Other types of activities during which we may collect information, including personal information in some cases, include:\nPayment and Credit Card Information\nIn order order to make facilitate payments between travelers and providers we collect (through a PCI-compliant third-party service) credit card and other payment information from travelers and payment collection information, such as bank account information from providers.\nGeo-Location Information\nWhen you use the Services, we may collect precise location data from the App. If you permit the App to access location services through the permission system used by your mobile operating system, we may also collect the precise location of your device when the App is running in the foreground or background.

Other than for the tracking purposes identified above, this information is collected in aggregate form, without identifying any user individually. Okkami may use this aggregate, non-identifying statistical data for statistical analysis, marketing or similar promotional purposes.\n\nInformation Sharing\nWe may share the information we collect about you through our services: With providers to enable them to provide the Services you request. For example, we share your name, photo (if you provide one), average User rating given by providers, and pickup and/or drop-off locations with providers;\nWith third parties to provide you a service you requested through a partnership or promotional offering made by a third party or us;\nWith the general public if you submit content in a public forum, such as blog comments, social media posts, or other features of our Services that are viewable by the general public;\nWith third parties with whom you choose to let us share information, for example other Apps or websites that integrate with our API or Services, or those with an API or Service with which we integrate;\nWith Okkami subsidiaries and affiliated entities that provide services or conduct data processing on our behalf, or for data centralization and / or logistics purposes;\nWith vendors, consultants, marketing partners, and other service providers who need access to such information to carry out work on our behalf;\nIn response to a request for information by a competent authority if we believe disclosure is in accordance with, or is otherwise required by, any Applicable law, regulation, or legal process;\nWith law enforcement officials, government authorities, or other third parties if we believe your actions are inconsistent with our User agreements, Terms of Service, or policies, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Okkami or others;\nIn connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, consolidation or restructuring, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by or into another company;\nIf we otherwise notify you and you consent to the sharing; and In an aggregated and/or anonymized form which cannot reasonably be used to identify you.\n\nSocial Media\nThe Services may integrate with social sharing Media and other related tools which let you share actions you take on our Services with other Apps, sites, or media, and vice versa. Your use of such features enables the sharing of information with your friends or the public, depending on the settings you establish with the social sharing service. Please refer to the privacy policies of those social sharing services for more information about how they handle the data you provide to or share through them.\n\nInternational Transmission\nWhen you submit personal information to Okkami through the App and/or Site, you understand and agree that this information may be transmitted across national boundaries and may be stored and processed in any of the countries in which Okkami and its affiliates and subsidiaries maintain offices, including without limitation, the United States. You also acknowledge that in certain countries or with respect to certain activities, the collection, transferring, storage and processing of your information may be undertaken by trusted vendors of Okkami in connection with the processing and/or fulfillment of transactions and/or orders for products or services. Such vendors are bound by data protection laws meeting the European Commission’s Directive on Data Protection or by contract to not use your personal information for their own purposes or provide it to any third parties except in connection with providing products or services you request or as you may opt-in. One instance where this could occur is in conjunction with framed pages in which the URL for the pages is not visible and the pages are being hosted by a vendor of Okkami.\n\nService providers\nOkkami may have established relationships with various service providers whose services are available to you from the App and Site or from Linked Sites. Typically, these providers offer services or products that Okkami customers might find useful, such as those that can be used in conjunction with Okkami products and services. To use those services, you may be required to provide personal information to the providers. Unless expressly provided to the contrary, personal information that you provide while you are visiting a provider’s website will be subject to the privacy policy posted on such site and personal information that you provide while on this Site in conjunction with a provider’s service will be subject to this Privacy Policy. You should be aware that our agreements with these service providers often provide that they will share with Okkami personal information collected from you. In such instances, Okkami may use this information in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy.\n\nMobile Operating System Permissions\nMost mobile systems (iOS, Android, etc.) have defined certain types of device data that Apps cannot access without your consent. And these platforms have different permission systems for obtaining your consent. The iOS platform will alert you the first time the Okkami App wants permission to access certain types of data and will let you consent (or not consent) to that request. Android devices will notify you of the permissions that the Okkami App seeks before you first use the App, and your use of the App constitutes your consent.\n\nConsent\nBy voluntarily providing us with your name, e-mail address, postal address (snail mail), telephone number, billing address, and credit card number, you consent to our use of such information to provide that service or product to you and for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.  We may allow others to provide audience measurement and analytics services for us, to serve advertisements on our behalf across the Internet, and to track and report on the performance of those advertisements. These entities may use cookies, web beacons, SDKs, and other technologies to identify your device when you visit our site and use our Services, as well as when you visit other online sites and services.\n\nInformation Disclosure\nWe do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to others. We may choose to do so in the future with trustworthy third parties, but you can instruct us not to by reading Your Choices below. There are other instances in which Okkami may divulge your personal information. Okkami may provide your personal information if necessary, in Okkami’s good faith judgment, to comply with laws or regulations of a governmental or regulatory body or in response to a valid subpoena, warrant or order or to protect the rights of Okkami or others. If Okkami goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, we reserve the right to transfer your personal information, which will likely be among the assets transferred. You will be notified via prominent notice on our Site for 30 days of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.\n\nYour Choices\nOkkami practices opt-in permission marketing. The Site and any email sent to you will enable you to opt-out of receiving future communications from us. To opt-out of receiving such communications or to be included in our “do not share” list, contact us at info@Okkami.com or by following the unsubscribe directions in emails sent to you.  California law permits residents of California to request certain details about how their information is shared with third parties for direct marketing purposes. Okkami does not share your personally identifiable information with third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes unless you provide us with consent to do so\n\nUpdating Your Personal Information\nUpon request, Okkami will provide you with access to your personal information that we have on record. You may correct your account information at any time by logging into your online or in-App account. If you wish to cancel your account, please email us at info@Okkami.com. Please note that in some cases we may retain certain information about you as required by law, or for legitimate business purposes to the extent permitted by law. For instance, if you have a standing credit or debt on your account, or if we believe you have committed fraud or violated our Terms of Use (“TOU”), we may seek to resolve the issue before deleting your information.  Users can request their personal information at any time by contacting us. We will make every effort to ensure your right to privacy by reviewing, qualifying and validating Visitor Information Requests before disseminating such information.\n",
  "TERMS_OF_SERVICE_DETAIL_3": "Privacy-Related Inquiries and Complaints\nOkkami takes its users’ privacy concerns seriously. If you believe that Okkami has not complied with this Privacy Policy with respect to your personal information or you have other related inquiries or concerns, you may write to us at the address above. In your letter, please describe in as much detail as possible the nature of your inquiry or the ways in which you believe the Privacy Policy has not been complied with. We will investigate your inquiry or complaint promptly. If you do not receive an acknowledgment of your inquiry or complaint or your inquiry or complaint is not satisfactorily addressed, you should then contact the Okkami legal department, who will serve as a liaison with this Site to resolve your concerns. Please note that if you provide Okkami with inconsistent privacy preferences (for example, by indicating on one occasion that third parties may contact you with marketing offers and indicating on another occasion that they may not), Okkami cannot guarantee that your most recent privacy preference will be honored.\n\nOther websites and Your Privacy Concerns\nOur Site contains links to other websites that are not owned or operated by Okkami. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites.
